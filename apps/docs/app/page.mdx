# Welcome

Hello Workshop Atendee, or Internet User, 

<ExternalLink href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</ExternalLink> is a Developer Platform, and we provide tooling so developers and companies can build tools we all love and use everyday, securely. 

In this workshop, you'll build an AI Agent, AI-native service that can be easily integrated into various AI workflows. Complete with an Agent, and MCP Server, all secured by Auth0.

## Story 

DemoTradePro Corp offers a fictional Stock Trading for fictional universes. Due to the increasing demand in AI Agents, and Agentic web they have determined that they must 

### Existing Components 

For the purpose of this workshop we will use shared services that are provided to us, these mimic how companies have deployed applications today

* <PlatformLink type="app">Web Application</PlatformLink> this web application itself that end-users can use.
* <PlatformLink type="api">API Server</PlatformLink> this API Server hosts the business logic for the api.
* <PlatformLink type="auth">Identity Provider</PlatformLink> this is the Identity Provider for Demo Trade Pro services

Before we begin, please make sure you visit <PlatformLink type="app">Web Application</PlatformLink> and create an account. We will leverage this account throughout the workshop as your "Demo Trade Pro" account, the agent will get delegated access to this account.

For extra credits, you may wish to make a few trades in the web application, so that we can see the portfolio in action.

## Repeatable Pattern

You'll learn a **repeatable pattern** that can be applied to any API or service, and existing apps weather or not 

1. **Start with a basic chatbot** - Simple AI conversation interface
2. **Add public tools** - Connect to DemoTradePRO API Endpoints that don't require authentication
3. **Add user authentication** - Make the agent aware of who's using it
4. **Add authenticated tools** - Access user-specific, securely
5. **Package as <ExternalLink href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io">MCP Server</ExternalLink>** - Wrap everything into a reusable component which can also be used by <ExternalLink href="https://claude.ai">Claude</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink href="https://cursor.sh">Cursor</ExternalLink> or any AI Agent.

While we're using DemoTradePro as our example, the final agent architecture you'll build can sit **in front of any existing API**. The authentication patterns, tool calling mechanisms, and MCP packaging you'll learn here are universally applicable.

 By the end of this workshop, you'll have a functioning agent for turning any API into an AI-native service that can be easily integrated into various AI workflows.

## Key Security Concepts

- **Leveraging Short-lived tokens** - 5-minute TTL for minimal blast radius
- **<ExternalLink href="https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault">Token Vault</ExternalLink>** - Secure token exchange instead keys that grant broad access
- **<ExternalLink href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693">On-Behalf-Of (OBO)</ExternalLink>** - User tokens → API tokens

## Prerequisites

This workshop leverages Typescript and the <ExternalLink href="https://ai-sdk.dev">Vercel AI SDK</ExternalLink>, the final agent can be deployed to <ExternalLink href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</ExternalLink>. All the necessary tools, and libraries are included in your [starter kit](https://github.com/ciamshrek/demo-trade-pro) and will automatically be installed, but we require 3 dependencies

- <ExternalLink href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</ExternalLink> (LTS 22 is preferred) 
- <ExternalLink href="https://pnpm.io">PNPM</ExternalLink> (optional)
- <ExternalLink href="https://auth0.com/docs/cli">Auth0 CLI</ExternalLink>
- <ExternalLink href="https://terraform.io">Terraform</ExternalLink> 

If you are having trouble installing these please consult the helpers in the workshop.
