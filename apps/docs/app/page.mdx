# Welcome

Hello Workshop Atendee, or Internet User, 

Auth0 is a Developer Platform, and we provide tooling so developers and companies can build tools we all love and use everyday, securely. 

In this workshop, you'll build an AI Agent, AI-native service that can be easily integrated into various AI workflows. Complete with an Agent, and MCP Server, all secured by Auth0.

**DemoTradePro Agent Workshop**

In this hands-on session you'll build an AI agent that can trade on your behalf—securely.

## Story 

DemoTradePro Corp offers a fictional Stock Trading for fictional universes. Due to the increasing demand in AI Agents, and Agentic web they have determined that they must 

### Existing Components 

For the purpose of this workshop we will use shared services that are provided to us, these mimic how companies have deployed applications today

* [Web Application](https://workshop-web-app.auth101.dev) this web application itself that end-users can use.
* [API Server](https://workshop-stock-api.auth101.dev) this API Server hosts the business logic for the api.
* [Identity Provider](https://workshop-stock-idp.auth101.dev) this is the Identity Provider for Demo Trade Pro services


## Repeatable Pattern

You'll learn a **repeatable pattern** that can be applied to any API or service, and existing apps weather or not 

1. **Start with a basic chatbot** - Simple AI conversation interface
2. **Add public tools** - Connect to DemoTradePRO API Endpoints that don't require authentication
3. **Add user authentication** - Make the agent aware of who's using it
4. **Add authenticated tools** - Access user-specific, securely
5. **Package as MCP Server** - Wrap everything into a reusable component which can also be used by Claude, Cursor or any AI Agent.

While we're using DemoTradePro as our example, the final agent architecture you'll build can sit **in front of any existing API**. The authentication patterns, tool calling mechanisms, and MCP packaging you'll learn here are universally applicable.

 By the end of this workshop, you'll have a functioning agent for turning any API into an AI-native service that can be easily integrated into various AI workflows.

## Key Security Concepts

- ⏱️ **Leveraging Short-lived tokens** - 5-minute TTL for minimal blast radius
- 🔐 **Token Vault** - Secure token exchange instead keys that grant broad access
- 🔄 **On-Behalf-Of (OBO)** - User tokens → API tokens

## Prerequisites

This workshop leverages Typescript and the Vercel AI SDK, the final agent can be deployed to Vercel. All the necessary tools, and libraries are included in your [starter kit](https://github.com/ciamshrek/demo-trade-pro) and will automatically be installed, but we require 3 dependencies

- Node.js (LTS 22 is preferred) 
- PNPM (optional)
- Auth0 CLI
- Terraform 

If you are having trouble installing these please consult the helpers in the workshop.
