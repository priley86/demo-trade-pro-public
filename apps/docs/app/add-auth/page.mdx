# Add Authentication to Your Agent

## Why Authentication Matters

Your agent currently works great with public tools, but has a critical limitation: **it doesn't know who you are**. Without user identity, your agent can't:

- Access personalized data (like your portfolio)
- Make user-specific decisions
- Maintain secure boundaries between users
- Provide truly personalized AI experiences

In this step, we'll solve this by adding Auth0 authentication, transforming your anonymous chatbot into a **personalized AI agent** that knows who it's helping.

## What we're building in this step

    Auth0->>Agent: Callback with tokens
    Agent->>Agent: Store session
    Agent->>User: Show authenticated chat
    
    Note over Agent: Defense in depth:
    Note over Agent: Middleware + Page + API protection
    
    User->>Agent: "What's WAYNE stock price?"
    Agent->>API: getStockPrice('WAYNE')
    API->>Agent: $150.25
    Agent->>User: "WAYNE is $150.25"
`} />

**Security layers we're adding:**
- ✅ **Middleware protection** - Auth0 redirects for all routes
- ✅ **Server-side page protection** - `withPageAuthRequired()`
- ✅ **API route protection** - Session verification in chat endpoint
- 🔄 **Next:** Add portfolio tools with token delegation

## Create your Auth0 tenant

First, create your own Auth0 tenant for authentication:

Go to **<ExternalLink href="https://auth0.ai">https://auth0.ai</ExternalLink>** 


1. **Click "Get Started"** and then complete the signup process

    ![Auth0 Landing](/auth0-landing.png)

2. Select a region and approve the "Terms and Conditions" for GenAI Developer Preview 

    ![Auth0 Tenant Creation](/auth0-add-locality.png)

3. Click *Continue* button, the tenant name will be automatically generated for

    ![Auth0 Dashboard](/auth0-tenant-with-highlight.png)

4. **Note your tenant domain** - You'll need this (e.g., `genai-9199191919199191.us.auth0.com`)


## Set up Auth0 CLI and initialize your tenant

Configure the Auth0 CLI and run the initialization script:

```bash
# Login to Auth0 CLI
auth0 login --scopes create:client_grants

# Select your newly created tenant when prompted
# Navigate to agent directory and run init script
cd auth0-agent
./init.sh
```

**What the init script does:**

- ✅ **Creates Management Client** - Auth0 client for Terraform
- ✅ **Runs Terraform** - Sets up API resource and agent application, along with an Enterprise OIDC connection.  
- ✅ **Generates Environment** - Creates `apps/agent/.env` file

**Note:** At the time of this writing, our Terraform scripts do not yet support some steps and newly released features around Token Vault and the Auth0 My Account API (**Connected Accounts**). Let's enable those now manually in the Auth0 Dashboard after Terraform scripts have completed by doing the following:

<strong>My Account API Settings</strong>
1. Navigate to Authentication > APIs, locate the My Account API banner, and select Activate to activate the Auth0 My Account API.
2. Once activated, select Auth0 My Account API and then select the Applications tab.
   * Toogle your **StockTrade** to authorize it to access the My Account API.
   * In the dropdown menu, select the Connected Accounts scopes for the **StockTrade** application, ensuring that at a minimum, the `create:me:connected_accounts` permission is selected.
   * Select **Update**
3. Still under the Auth0 My Account API, select the **Settings** tab.
   * Under **Access Settings**, select **Allow Skipping User Consent**. This is due to the fact we are using Multi-Resource Refresh Tokens when accessing the My Account API.

<strong>StockTrade Regular Web Application Settings</strong>

Now, let's define a Multi-Resource Refresh Token policy for your Application:
1. Navigate to Applications > Applications and select your **Stock Trade** application.
   * On the **Settings** tab, scroll down to the **Multi-Resource Refresh Token** section.
   * Select Edit Configuration and then enable the MRRT toggle for the **Auth0 My Account API** and your **StockTrade MCP Server**.
2. Scroll down within **Settings** tab to **Advanced Settings**. Expand the toggle and select **Grant Types** tab.
   * Make sure that **Authorization Code**, **Refresh Token**, **Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA)**, **Token Vault** and all are enabled.
   * Once you've enabled CIBA, you'll see CIBA options above. Making sure the **Guardian Push** Notification Channel is enabled.
   * Hit the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.

<strong>DemoTradePro OIDC Connection</strong>
1. Navigate to **Authentication -> Enterprise** and select **OpenID Connect**. Next select your **demotradepro-oidc** connection open the **Settings** tab. Scroll to the bottom and the **Purpose** section.
   * Ensure that you enable **Use for Authentication** and **Use for Connected Accounts with Token Vault** toggles.
   * Hit the **Save Changes** button.

## Install NextJS Auth0 SDK

Install the Auth0 NextJS SDK (version 4.13.0 or higher):

```bash
cd apps/agent
pnpm add @auth0/nextjs-auth0@^4.13.0 jose
```

---

## Set up Auth0 client configuration

Now we need to setup the Auth0 SDK Integration in the Agent App itself.

**Create `lib/auth0.ts`:**

```typescript
import { Auth0Client } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0/server";

// Server-side agent Auth0 client instance
export const auth0 = new Auth0Client({
  logoutStrategy: "oidc",
  authorizationParameters: {
    audience: process.env.AUTH0_AUDIENCE,
    scope: process.env.API_DEFAULT_SCOPES,
    prompt: "login",
    connection: process.env.API_OIDC_CONNECTION_NAME,
  },
  enableConnectAccountEndpoint: true,
});
```

**What this does:**
- **Server-side client** - Handles authentication on the backend
- **Scope configuration** - Defines what permissions to request
- **Environment variables** - Auth0 will read the environment variables setup by the init script in `apps/agent/.env`

---

## Set up authentication middleware

Create middleware to protect all routes and adds the Auth0 route handlers such as /auth/login and /auth/logout.

**Create `middleware.ts` in the root of your agent app:**

```typescript
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { auth0 } from "./lib/auth0";

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Let Auth0 middleware handle authentication
  return await auth0.middleware(request);
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Protect ALL routes including root "/" - redirect to Auth0 login if not authenticated
     * Exclude only:
     * - _next/static (static files)
     * - _next/image (image optimization files) 
     * - favicon.ico, sitemap.xml, robots.txt (metadata files)
     */
    "/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|sitemap.xml|robots.txt).*)"
  ]
};
```

**What this does:**
- **Route protection** - Automatically protects all pages in your app
- **Static file exceptions** - Allows Next.js assets to load without auth
- **Defense in depth** - Works alongside page and API route protection

---

## Enable authentication in your page

Your template agent currently bypasses authentication. Let's enable it!

**Update `app/page.tsx` to use real authentication:**

```typescript
import { auth0 } from "../lib/auth0";
import ChatClient from "./components/chat-client";
import type { ReactElement } from "react";
import { AUTH0_DOMAIN } from "../lib/config";
import { decodeJwt } from "jose";

export default auth0.withPageAuthRequired(
  async function Chat() {
    const session = await auth0.getSession();
    const user = session?.user;

    // Check if the OIDC connection has been added to My Account API has been connected by:
    // 1. Looking for the Auth0 /me/ audience in accessTokens
    // 2. Validating the access token's sub field starts with "oidc|demotradepro-oidc"
    const meAudience = `https://${AUTH0_DOMAIN}/me/`;
    const oidcConnectionPrefix = `oidc|${process.env.API_OIDC_CONNECTION_NAME}`;

    const isAccountConnected =
      session?.accessTokens?.some((token) => {
        if (token.audience !== meAudience) {
          return false;
        }

        // Decode the JWT and check the sub field using jose
        try {
          const decoded = decodeJwt(token.accessToken);
          if (!decoded || !decoded.sub || typeof decoded.sub !== "string") {
            return false;
          }

          return decoded.sub.startsWith(oidcConnectionPrefix);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Failed to decode JWT:", error);
          return false;
        }
      }) ?? false;

    return (
      <ChatClient
        user={user!}
        connectionName={process.env.API_OIDC_CONNECTION_NAME!}
        defaultScopes={process.env.API_DEFAULT_SCOPES!}
        apiAudience={process.env.API_AUDIENCE!}
        isAccountConnected={isAccountConnected}
      />
    );
  },
  { returnTo: "/" }
) as unknown as () => Promise<ReactElement>;
```

**What this does:**
- **Server-side auth check** - Verifies user is authenticated before page renders
- **Automatic redirect** - Sends unauthenticated users to Auth0 login
- **Determines if your user has connected their DemoTradePro account** - Checks if the user has enabled the DemoTradePro connection using Auth0 My Account API. If they have not enabled the connection, they will see a button to enable it.

---

## Update your API route to use authentication

Your agent's API route needs to verify user identity. **Replace the entire contents of `app/api/chat/route.ts` with:**

```typescript
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText, UIMessage, convertToModelMessages, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { auth0 } from '../../../lib/auth0';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { agentTools } from './tools';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // Verify user is authenticated
  const session = await auth0.getSession();
  if (!session || !session.user) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
  }

  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();
  const user = session.user;

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
    system: `You are a helpful stock trading assistant for DemoTradePro. You provide trading advice, market insights, and help users understand stock market concepts. You are knowledgeable, professional, and always emphasize risk management.

You are currently assisting ${user.name || 'a user'} (${user.email || 'authenticated user'}).

Key guidelines:
- Always remind users that trading involves risk
- Provide educational information about stocks and markets
- Help with basic trading concepts and strategies
- Be conversational and helpful
- Never provide specific financial advice or guarantees
- You can reference the user by their name when appropriate

You now have access to real-time stock market data through your tools. Use them when users ask about stock prices, company information, or want to search for stocks.`,
    tools: agentTools,
    stopWhen: stepCountIs(15),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

**Key changes:**
- **Authentication check** - Verifies user session before processing
- **Personalized system prompt** - AI knows the user's name and email
- **Tools included** - Your public stock tools still work!
- **401 Unauthorized** - Clear error response for invalid sessions

---

## Test your authenticated agent

Visit <ExternalLink showFavicon={false} href="http://localhost:3003">http://localhost:3003</ExternalLink>

1. **Automatic redirect** to Auth0 login
2. **After login** - redirected back to chat
3. **Test stock tools:** "Who am I?"
4. **Personalized response** - AI should greet you by name!

---

## 🎯 What's Next?

**You now have:** Fully secured AI agent with complete authentication!

**Security Achievement:**
- 🔒 **Defense in depth** - Middleware + page + API protection
- 👤 **User identity** - AI knows who you are and personalizes responses
- 🚫 **Zero unauthorized access** - Every entry point requires Auth0 authentication

**But there's a problem:** How does your agent access *your* portfolio data from the API?
